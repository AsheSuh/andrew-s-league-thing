                alliedADC: {
                    "Miss Fortune": "Take short trades with Miss Fortune early as she lacks the damage for an all-in from full health unless the enemy is squishy. Look for E when Miss Fortune uses her E as the slow will make it hard for the enemy to dodge. After level 6 always save your R to combo with Miss Fortune's R, you can 1 shot anyone with just this combo.",
                    "Caitlyn": "Play slow with Caitlyn allowing her to poke with her range before you look for a committed fight. Ask Caitlyn to put a trap in the front of the lane bush and be ready to E an enemy who steps on it. Try to stun enemies outside of minions so Caitlyn can hit her E for a 1 shot combo.",
                    "Ezreal": "Fight with Ezreal before the minions arrive, otherwise give him the chance to get stacks of his passive and to clear the wave so it's easy for him to hit his Q, then commit to an all in as Ezreal is extremely strong with passive stacks. Be aware of Ezreal's item buy, often he won't be attack damage for his first item so he won't have the immediate follow up damage of other ADC's. At level 6 try to cheese the enemy from the lane bush as you can 1 shot anyone if you Combo your stuns with Ezreal's ultimate.",
                    "Kai'sa": "Play extremely aggressive the first few levels with Kaisa, your E and Q gives her stacks of plasma (passive) meaning you should focus the same target for a quick 1 shot. Fight outside of the wave or clear minions first. Make note of Kai'sa's Hail Of Blades and/or Q cooldown when looking for fights. When Kai'sa is level 6 you can be extremely aggressive, often using your Flash Q or E to guarantee a stack of Kai'sa's passive so that she can ult and dive with you.",
                    "Jhin": "Don't try to all-in tankier targets with Jhin as he lacks the damage to kill targets from full health, it's better to use E when Jhin has 2 bullets, and then quickly disengage after he uses his last for a nice short trade. Make track of Jhin's W cooldown, engage when he has it so that he you can guarantee it hits by chaining crowd control, take note of when Jhin uses his W, if he instantly casts it on your E you should hold your Q to use as Jhin's W is about to expire.",
                    "Samira": "Level 1 you can all-in with Samira easily if you hit Q or E, if she starts E she can easily chase the enemy down and if she starts Q she will stack her Conqueror incredibly fast meaning you will win any long fight so be willing to die for a fight as long as your Samira can hit. Your Q and E will set up Samira's passive, meaning you can engage on enemies further away and Samira will be able to dash to follow up. Try to take long fights where Samira can stack up her passive and Keystone. In team fights try crowd control in range of Samira so that she can stack her passive up and unlock her ultimate, you can then use your R to combo with her.",
                    "Sivir": "Always wait until Sivir has her Q before you engage, she can easily land both parts of her Q when you stun, meaning you repeatedly take this short trade until you choose to commit to one. At level 6 when Sivir ulti's you can often use the move speed to run into range to use Q, this is a lot more reliable than trying to hit E unnecessarily.",
                    "Tristana": "Level 1 you should be incredibly aggressive while Tristana has her E up, you can most often even focus a tank support and win as Tristana has incredibly high damage. If you hit E on a squishy target, run forward and continue fighting, if the enemy uses any crowd control on you, Tristana can jump in without fear.",
                    "Jinx": "Level 1 playing for push letting Jinx take push over the wave with rockets, when you do fight prolong the fight as long as possible so that Jinx can stack up her minigun and Lethal Tempo, if you die for her to trade kill she will get passive so don't be afraid to do in a skirmish if it gets her a reset. Look for engages at level 3 when Jinx can use her traps (E) as this is your best time to fight. At level 6 try to look for a cheese from the lane bush, if you can hit a stun even a tank support will be one shot with Jinx's traps and ultimate.",
                    "Lucian": "Level 1 only take short trades if the target is a tank support, Lucian has long cooldowns and relies on his abilities. Level 3 is the best time to fight, E forward when Lucian has Q and E and if you can't kill backout after he uses all of his burst. Later on don't be afraid to engage on an enemy even when Lucian is far away as he can quickly follow up Galeforce, E and R",
                    "Vayne": "Level 1 Vanye has incredible solo kill potential, if you hit crowd control when she is in range you can often full commit and chase the enemy down. Level 6 Vayne is at her strongest point in lane, you can win any 2v2 in the game with this combo so don't be afraid to engage even on the support.",
                    "Ashe": "Level 1 don't overcommit to taking an extended fight as Ashe lacks damage early, instead trade around her W cooldown and play for push. Look for E when Ashe uses her W to make it easier to land while the enemy is slowed. At level 6 try to cheese from the lane bush as you have enough crowd control to burst even tank supports if layered correctly.",
                    "Twitch": "Ask your Twitch what ability he is starting level 1, he is extremely strong level 1 so you should look for something, you can look for a surprise cheese if he starts Q and you hit E when he exits stealth, otherwise it's best to fight while the enemy is standing in his W. Try to make fights go for as long as possible so that Twitch can stack up his poison (passive). In at level 6 and in mid game wait for Twitch to stealth into position when he wants to look for a pick, then snipe with your R whoever his target is so that he can quickly burst them.",
                    "Draven": "Draven is incredibly strong level 1, wait for him to get two axes (Q) then look for an all-in on your Q or even E if it's a squishy target. Don't be afraid to tower dive and die if it gets your Draven a kill as he'll quickly snowball with his passive. At level 6 try to cheese from the lane bush, you can 1 shot even tank supports with your crowd control and Draven's R.",
                    "Varus": "Level 1 wait for Varus to last hit a minion to get attack speed from his passive, then you can look for a short trade, backing out once Varus uses his E. Play for push and don't E in unless Varus has his cooldowns, taking repeated short trades until you're confident you can kill. At level 6 look for a cheese from the bush as you have enough crowd control to 1 shot even tank supports if you layer it correctly.",
                    "Nilah": "Remember with Nilah you will hit level 2 a minion early, use this to take a surprise all-in. Nilah stacks up his Conqueror/Lethal Tempo twice as fast as normal ADC's therefore you should keep an eye on how many stacks she has and try and keep a fight as long as possible. Remember to run to Nilah to receive the dodge from her W when in trouble. At level 6 you can often wait for Nilah to use her ultimate to pull enemies together then combo it with your R to hit them all.",
                    "Kalista": "Level 1 you can commit to an all-in if you hit Q or even El on a squishy target while Kalista is in range. Kalista is very dependent on her Q cooldown and/or Hail Of Blades, so try not to hook forward unless she has them as it's a large part of her damage and gap close. At level 6 remember to block abilities for Kalista as she can always ulti you to save you. Try to engage with Kalista's ultimate as it's easy to hit, and then combo your other abilities off of it.",
                    "Aphelios": "Play slow level 1 allowing Aphelios to poke with his range and win the sustain war, focus on hitting creeps to take push and then look for an engage once you have a health and minion advantage. When Aphelios has his purple gun it's sometimes best to let him initiate, wait for him to use his snare (Q) so you can easily hit E or run up and Q. When Aphelios has his white gun it's the best time to all-in, don't be afraid to Flash on the enemy if Aphelios is able to get close range to attack.",
                    "Xayah": "Level 1 ask you Xayah if they can start W if you hit a Q at the very start of the lane, you can often burn summoner spells like this but be sure to back out when her W ends, if Xayah starts Q play for push and wait for her level 2 before fighting. Level 3 Xayah is at her strongest, try to hit E when she is range to land an autoattack and has Q so she can snare, this will most often kill an enemy.",
                    "Zeri": "Play slow with Zeri level 1, don't fight when there are minions around, instead focus on clearing the wave. After level 2 you can take short trades outside creeps, when you hit E let Zeri proc her passive and hit her W then back out if you can't finish the kill. At level 6 Zeri is at her strongest, look for an all-in, the longer the fight goes for the harder Zeri will carry so try to prolong the fight and make the enemy chase you when you get low.",
                    "Kog'Maw": "Level 1 look for an engage while Kog Maw has his W, even on a tank support as he has massive damage and will win the fight, just be sure to disengage when Kog Maw's W expires. It's often a good idea to base when Kog Maw can afford his upgraded boots, this way it's easy for him to stay in range whilst his W is active. Play with Kog Maw in teamfights once he has 2 items as he'll be incredibly strong."
                },
                enemyADC: {
                    "Miss Fortune": "Level 1 Miss Fortune has less up front damage than most ADC's early meaning you will win a commit fight from full health even if you focus her support, if you can get in range of anyone start Q and fight, but starting E is also an option if you have a high damage ADC and can hit it when they are trading. Try and fake and engage to force Miss Fortune to use E, you can easily then easily find an engage while it's down as she won't be able to slow you. At level 6 try to engage first in the 2v2 as if the enemy land crowd control and Miss Fortune can channel her R you can be 1 shot. In teamfights if Miss Fortune is strong you should almost always save your R to be used to cancel Miss Fortune's ultimate. If necessary try to crash a minion wave early and base to heal and buy a Refillable Potion, then take an all-in from full health.",
                    "Caitlyn": "Consider taking Sweeping Lens level 1 to use in the lane bush to avoid Caitlyn's attacks or to sweep river wards to setup ganks when she pushes, if you can ever get close enough to use Q you will instantly win, otherwise it's best to avoid trading completely and wait until you're level 3 or receive a gank. Play in the lane bushes, but be careful if Caitlyn puts a trap in one, use the bushes to get close enough to land you E or even just to avoid poke. Try to crash a minion wave early and base to heal and buy a Refillable Potion, then take an all-in from full health before you can be poked out.",
                    "Ezreal": "Level 1 start Q unless you have a very aggressive ADC and can kill with just your E and the Glacial keystone, play inside the minion wave where you can hit creeps and play to get level 2 first and all-in. Keep track of Ezreals passive stacks, don't begin a fight when he has more than 3 stacks unless you can land crowd control on him. Your E will follow Ezreal even if he uses his E, therefore it's sometimes worth it to use E just as the crowd control from your Q ends so that you will follow Ezreal and be able to continue hitting him. Play close attention to Ezreal's runes and items, if he has any tenacity your Q into R combo won't chain crowd control meaning he can use his E away, so it may be worth building Anathema's Chains or holding onto your R.",
                    "Kai'sa": "Start Q level 1, if you fight level 1 do it inside of creeps or when Kai'sa doesn't have Q and try disengage before Kai'sa can proc her Plasma. Your Bone Plating and W are both very important cooldowns as Kai'sa has high burst damage, try to engage when you have these cooldowns. Consider buying an early Ruby Crystal or Cloth Armor to better survive Kai'sa's burst damage. When Kai'sa is level 6, remember not to run behind her after you land your E, otherwise she can use her ultimate on you to escape. Consider buying an early Ruby Crystal or Cloth Armor to better survive against burst.",
                    "Jhin": "Level 1 Jhin lacks the damage to kill you before running out of bullets, look to commit to an all-in, you can focus preferably Jhin but you can also ignore him and focus his support as you'll still outdamage him, try to start Q and get into range to use it but you can also start E if you have an aggressive ADC and can't get in range otherwise. In trades try to hit Jhin with your W so that you keep the bonus armor, or backout while it's still active to reduce the damage of his 4th shot. When Jhin runs forward to use his 4th shot, it's a great time to hit your E while he stands still to attack, this way you will start a trade while he is reloading. Pay attention to when Jhin finishes his Galeforce so that you don't waste your ultimate trying to hit him when he has it.",
                    "Samira": "Level 1 you should almost always start Q as Samira has short range meaning you can quickly close the distance if you use the lane bushes, be careful not to give her too many stacks of her passive and Conqueror while trying to engage, if this does happen back up until they expire and then try again to fight. Don't be afraid to trade your E cooldown for Samira's W as it has a 30 second cooldown, meaning you can engage before it's back up. When you land an E, quickly use Q and then run to the side of Samira, be careful not to run behind her as she can use her E to you to escape. Pay attention to when Samira finishes her Immortal Shieldbow, you will need Ignite or chain CC to kill her as she will have tons of lifesteal from it + Conqueror.  In teamfights it's best to save your Q when Samira is close to having her ultimate as it's the most reliable way to cancel it.",
                    "Sivir": "Level 1 you should try to start Q and close the distance as Sivir has short range, although you can start E if you have a high damage ADC and can win without Q, try to fight before Sivir has a chance to take push over the wave. Look to fight anytime Sivir doesn't have a level lead / big minion wave as this is the only way she will have enough damage to win a straight fight versus you. Don't be afraid to trade your E for Sivir's spellshield (E) and it has a 24 second cooldown, meaning you can look for a re-engage before it's back up. At level 6 look to surprise Sivir by quickly using Flash + Q into your R from the lane bush to quickly surprise her before she can use spellshield.",
                    "Tristana": "Start Q level 1 and don't engage on Tristana's support level 1 unless they are a very quick 1 shot if Tristana still has her E up as she will return too much damage. In lane walk at Tristana to bait her to use her E on you, look for an all-in whenever her E is down and never ignore Tristana whilst she has it up. Play close to your ADC in lane so that Tristana can't jump past you and kill your ADC before you can catch up. At level 6 if you have an E you should hold your R, there is a small gap in your E + Q combo where Tristana can sometimes use her jump (W) even while stunned to dodge your R, so hold it to be used after her jump.",
                    "Jinx": "Level 1 try to start Q and take short trades on Jinx's support or use the lane bushes to get close enough to hit her, if you have an aggressive ADC level 1 and can win without your Q you can consider starting E. Jinx will win long trades after stacking her Q and Lethal Tempo, if you go in and don't have the damage to burst someone, try to only engage when you have the damage to kill or quickly disengage after you've used your cooldowns using the lane bushes to deny the enemies vision. Anytime you hit your E on Jinx or her support, quickly use Q and run past them so that you don't get caught in Jinx's traps (E) if she uses them. In teamfights try to use your R to stop Jinx getting into range to attack once the fight has started, and be sure to try and live so that Jinx doesn't get to proc her passive off your death.",
                    "Lucian": "Level 1 you should start Q and wait for Lucian to use his ability, you can then try using the lane bushes to close the distance to trade with him or his support, consider starting E if you have a high damage ADC and can win a fight without you Q. After level 3 stand close to your ADC so that Lucian can't dash on them while you're out of range, Lucian's damage is dependent on his cooldowns, so look to commit to a fight if he uses his Q or E especially. Play around your Bone plating cooldown taking engages when it's up as it's incredibly effective versus Lucians passive. Pay attention to Lucian's items and note when he finishes his Galeforce so that you don't waste your ultimate trying to hit him if he still has it.",
                    "Vayne": "Level 1 take note of Vayne's keystone, if she has Press The Attack or Hail Of Blades try to avoid short trades, if she has Lethal Tempo then don't let the fight go long, start Q and try to only focus Vayne, if you land crowd control on her you can win, otherwise play for push and fight at level 2. If Vayne ever uses Q forward for a trade you should instantly E her and all-in, be careful wasting your E though as if you don't have it she is free to trade forward like this. At level 6 Vayne is extremely strong, only fight her if you can land crowd control, try to engage first as it will be easier to catch her before she uses her ultimate to go stealth.",
                    "Ashe": "Level 1 if you can land it start Q, Ashe lacks damage and will lose a committed fight even if you engage on her support, consider starting E if you have an aggressive ADC and can win a fight without your Q. Use the lane bushes as you can easily run back into them to break vision at the end of a trade so that Ashe doesn't constantly slow you and trade back well.. Consider buying Boots Of Swiftness or Mercury Treads versus Ashe so that you can continue closing the distance when she uses her W. At level 6 It's best if you engage before she does, if she does engage first you should quickly use your own R to stop the enemy from following up. If needed try to crash a minion wave early and base to heal and buy a Refillable Potion",
                    "Twitch": "Level 1 when you walk into lane stand close to your ADC incase Twitch has started stealth (Q), if Twitch kites back well and you can't land your Q you should concede level 1 as he's very strong in a long fight. Level 3 is your strongest point and so is when you should look for an all-in, try to fein an engage so that Twitch wastes his W, without the slow from this he cannot stop you closing the distance and landing your E. If Twitch is strong then in teamfights save either your R or your E + Flash for when he exits stealth so you can quickly crowd control him before he can use his entire ultimate.",
                    "Draven": "Level 1 start Q and play in the lane bushes, if Draven missteps and you land Q you can commit to an all-in and win, otherwise play safe and be willing to concede push, avoid trading until you are level 3 and have trimmed the enemy minion wave. Aim your E for where Draven's axe (Q) is landing so he's forced to drop his axe or get hit. If Draven is using his E to cancel your E you will have a small window to engage again before it's back up as its 18 second cooldown is longer than your E, even if you don't find another engage this trade will quickly make Draven run out of mana. In teamfights use your R on Draven even if he isn't your target to stop him from getting in range to attack or make him drop his axes. Consider buying an early Ruby Crystal or Cloth Armor to better survive against burst.",
                    "Varus": "Level 1 you can start E with an aggressive ADC otherwise start Q, look for an all-in instantly before Varus has a chance to kill a minion to get the attack speed bonus from his passive, do so by using the lane bush to run past the wave and fight him. Try to fake an engage to bait out Varus' E, then look again while it's on cooldown as he has no way to stop your engage and is reliant on his cooldowns. At level 6 in the 2v2 try to engage first, if he does use his ultimate first you should quickly use your own to stop any follow up from him and his team. If necessary try to crash a minion wave early and base to heal and buy a Refillable Potion, then take an all-in from full health.",
                    "Nilah": "Level 1 start Q and try to use the lane bushes to get in range to land it, Nilah is strong level 1 as she can quickly stack runes like Conqueror if she isn't stunned so back off before she gets high stacks if you can't kill, also remember Nilah and her support will get level 2 a minion earlier than you because of her passive. After level 3 play around Nilah's W, it has a 26 second cooldown meaning you should bait it out first and then commit to a fight while it's on cooldown. Nilah will get level 6 early because of her passive, don't fight her until you and your ADC are level 6. Your Ignite is very valuable in fights once Nilah has her mythic item, save it for when Nilah goes in as you need the healing cut to kill her.",
                    "Kalista": "Level 1 you should most often start Q but can consider starting E if you have an aggressive ADC and don't focus on the enemy support if Kalista is in range to deal damage, if you have to, concede push and wait for level 2. Play around your Glacial Augment cooldown in lane as Kalista suffers when slowed. Try waiting for Kalista to attack you and see which way she jumps, you can aim your E for where she will land and she won't be able to dodge without flashing. When committing to a fight it's often better to Flash Q and follow up with other abilities  instead of trying to aim your E or R so that the engage is guaranteed.",
                    "Aphelios": "Level 1 take Sweeping Lens so that you can deny vision and play in the lane bush, use this to try to instantly take a fight with your Q even if it's on Aphelios' support as he cannot return much damage in a committed fight, you can consider E start if you have an aggressive ADC. Look to fight Aphelios anytime you can get into range to land E up until he has his white gun, when he has white gun you should only commit to a fight if you have enough damage and crowd control to kill him without him being able to attack back. In teamfights you can use your ultimate to zone Aphelios from dealing damage, even if he is not your primary target this will prevent him from autoattacking for a few seconds.",
                    "Xayah": "Level 1 consider starting E if you have an aggressive ADC and can win without your Q, otherwise start Q, if Xayah starts W look to burn this cooldown then commit to a fight, otherwise if she starts Q you can look to instantly commit to a fight, until level 3 you can trade like this. After level 3 try to engage when Xayah doesn't have her E, if she does have it and you land your E you should quickly run behind her so that she can't hit you with her feather pull (E). At level 6 be careful about using your E on Xayah when she still has her ultimate, often she will be able to cast it before you can Q meaning she can trade back quite well after, don't be afraid to use your R even if just to trade ultimates.",

In lane it's often better to run at Zeri and Q, either you will land the Q stunning her or she will be forced to E making it very easy for you to land your own E. At level 6 Zeri is very strong if you don't land crowd control, it's often better to use Flash Q and following with other abilities to guarantee your engage.",
                    "Kog'Maw": "Level 1 start Q and try to avoid fighting Kog Maw unless he face checks you or wastes his W, don't start E as you'll most often lose even if it hits. You can walk at Kog Maw in lane to bait his W cooldown then quickly back out, when it expires you can then run past the wave and commit to an all-in as he's completely reliant on his W for fighting power. In teamfights even if Kog Maw isn't your main target you can use your R on him when he uses his W to prevent him from getting in range to deal damage. If necessary try to crash a minion wave early and base to heal and buy a Refillable Potion, then take an all-in from full health."

Try look for an E whenever Morgana doesn't have her bind(Q), even if she shields your E you can disengage for free as she has no crowd control, then look for another E before her shield is up from its long cooldown (24 seconds). You can use E on 1 target to bait Morgana's shield but hold you Q, then when Morgana uses shield quickly Flash Q the other target. You should almost always build Mercury Treads against Morgana. Be careful at level 6 especially if Morgana has a Zhonya's item. If necessary try to crash a minion wave early and base to heal and buy a Refillable Potion, then take an all-in from full health.",

Often if the enemy bot lane stands close together you can E to Yuumi so that she can't attach to her ADC to heal them, and then focus the ADC with your Q and auto attacks. You should constantly look for fights after level 3, Yuumi will quickly run out of mana if she has to constantly heal and so look for these engages when she walks up to auto attack you for her passive.",

Note if Lulu has Bone Plating / Guardian in her runes as if she doesn't she can likely be 1 shot in a single Q, if she does have them consider burning these cooldowns before focusing her. Play around Lulu's E timer, if she ever uses it aggressively or wastes it you should immediately look to fight. At level 6 it's often better to do an E into R combo as if you try to do E into Q a good Lulu player can interrupt this with her ultimate. Lulu is often the best target to focus in teamfights as she is often easier to kill than an ADC and isn't very tanky at all if she's crowd controlled and can't use ultimate.",

Play around Senna's W timer, if she ever uses it aggressively or wastes it you should immediately look to fight, you can often bait it by running forward and faking like you want to E.  If you land an E on the enemy ADC, quickly Q then run forward to dodge as Senna will often try and bind(W) you in order to disengage.

At level 6 you should try engage first, pay attention to Nautilus' items, if he bought boots instead of a defensive item you can 1 shot him in crowd control. In teamfights when he uses his ultimate on your carries be willing to be hit by it so that you can also block his hook for them.

Play around runes like bone plating, be confident tanking a hook and taking fights when you have yours up. After level 2 it's often better to engage on Pyke before Pyke can hook you as there is no threat on your ADC if you engage first, for the same reason you should most often focus on Pyke unless the enemy ADC mispositions. After level 6 Pyke is one of the best targets for you to focus as he can't build health, check if he has any Tenacity, if he doesn't you should make him your first target in a teamfight if there aren't any carries you can easily kill.

Try to E onto the enemy, if you ever get into melee range you will win, Thresh should be canceling you E with his Flay but if he doesn't do this or wastes it you should fight at every opportunity.

Consider building Mercury Treads versus Amumu, especially if he has any teammates with crowd control. When blocking Amumu's Q try to use W before it hits you so you have the resistances while crowd controlled, also play heavily around your Bone Platings cooldown. At level 6 try and engage first, if Amumu goes in first try to R his ADC to prevent their follow up, the same thing should be done in teamfights.

Be conservative with your Ignite, only using it if you can finish a kill, if you do use it, use it early in the fight as you need it to negate Soraka's healing.

If Jinx ever gets an enemy with her traps (E) you should instantly E them to chain the CC into your root.",
                    "Lucian": "Play around Lucians cooldowns as he's very weak without them, consider keeping fights shorter and disengaging after he's used all of his spells. Try to save your E for when Lucian dashes in, instantly E his target so that they can't fight back or Flash away.",
                    "Vayne": "Your all-in level 1 is extremely strong with Vayne if you get into a committed fight, be willing to fight the enemy before minions arrive, even consider cheesing them on the way to lane. Try to get an early base when Vayne has 800g if the enemy has a lot of poke so she can buy a lifesteal item. Your 2v2 is incredibly strong once Vayne has level 6, don't be afraid to commit to a fight.",
                    "Ashe": "Play the lane slow with Ashe, walk up and use Q when she pokes with Volley (W), try to only trade with autoattacks around these cooldowns so the enemy can't properly position. Try to focus the same target as Ashe and stack your slows, generally the closest target get be slowed and chased down prolonging a trade past when the enemy wants to.",
                    "Twitch": "Check Twitch's starting items, if he has Doran's ring it will be more important to conserve some of your health/mana so that you can heal him back up since he has no lifesteal. You are very strong in the first two levels and will win any extended trade, so try and use your Q slow so Twitch can stack his poison (passive). In late game if you have Ardent Censer it can be worth using your R when Twitch exits from stealth just to give him the attack boost effect for his ultimate.",
                    "Draven": "Wait until Draven has two axes (Q) before going aggressive, you will win almost any fight at level 1 and 2 as long as you fight with him. Don't be afraid to overcommit and die in lane, Draven has high damage meaning he will most likely trade the kill and trading kills is great for Draven to snowball with his passive.",
                    "Varus": "Wait for Varus to kill a minion before you fight as he gains attack speed (passive) from killing creeps. Play slow in this lane, only committing all-in if the enemy overextends into you, instead try push into tower and poke the enemies out. Varus has very long cooldowns so wait until he has his E before looking for a trade. When Varus uses his snare (R) you should instantly cast your E to chain the CC.",
                    "Nilah": "Remember you will get level 2 on the 2nd minion of the 2nd wave (1 minion early), Nilah is also very strong in extended fights level 1 so be willing to all-in. Nilah stacks Conqueror twice as fast as other ADC's, if she manages to get a few stacks for free, commit to a fight as she will often be able to clean up once it's fully stacked. Remember to run into Nilah to receive the dodge effect from her W if you need it.",
                    "Kalista": "When Kalista has skilled her W always try to attack the same target as her to proc its bonus damage. Kalista can easily chase down an overextended enemy, if you catch someone out with your Q be prepared to chase them down with Kalista. When Kalista uses her ultimate on you, use your E off of the knockup to guarantee it will chain CC into a root.",
                    "Aphelios": "Use your Q level 1 to keep the enemy at range since Aphelios can outrange most champions with his green gun, play this way until Aphelios has his white gun(lvl 5). When Aphelios has purple gun, wait until he roots(Q) them and then cast your E to chain the CC.",
                    "Xayah": "The best way to play the lane is for Xayah to constantly poke with her Q + E and you to do the same with your Q until the enemy is low, play slow like this until the enemy overcommitted into you, be willing to long trade only when Xayah has her W ready. Xayah has short range and can be easily poked when she tries to last hit, walk up with her to support her when the enemy minions are low health.",
                    "Zeri": "Zeri is weak early and cannot fight inside of minion waves, she's also has low damage compared to most ADC's before level 6, focus on farming during the early stages of lane. Zeri doesn't need much peel in teamfights because of her R and her E, consider playing around other members of your team who may need the peel more.",
                    "Kog'Maw": "Kog Maw's damage is dependent on his W cooldown, try to hit your Q level 1 when he's in range and then disengage when his W expires, you will win almost any fight so consider invading or fighting before minions spawn. Use the time while Kog Maw's W is on cooldown to trade 1v1 with the enemy support or hit minions for push, only take big fights while he has it up. Once Kogmaw has 2 items he will power spike, once at this point stay behind him in fights and save your E to peel him."

Play aggressively before Miss Fortune's first base as she lacks the damage of most other ADC's in a straight up fight. Play aggressively if Miss Fortune has Arcane comet, you'll be poked out if you play passive so try and fight her with your Q, especially when she doesn't have her E up.",

Use your Q whenever it can hit both Caitlyn and the minions, don't try to autoattack her without the slow from your Q. Try to push over the wave and crash it into tower, look for a recall whenever you can crash a wave and always buy Refillable Potion.

Click on Ezreal and stay aware how many stacks of his passive he has, if he has more than 3 he can most likely out damage you and in an even fight. Save your E later in the lane to use on him if he ever uses E aggressively, if he hits his W it's likely he will try to E forward so be ready. If Ezreal misses his Q it will have a 5 second cooldown, instantly run at him and trade in this small window.",

Try to constantly maintain push to prevent Kai'sa from getting her first base to heal and buy health potions, and be careful of her all-in after she recalls. Be careful if Kaisa walks in the bush or off screen as she will often cast W.

You only have to be afraid of Jhin's W in lane, be ready to dodge it whenever you trade, and play extremely aggressively when he doesn't have it. At level 6 be careful not to let yourself get low on health as his ultimate does % missing health damage, if he ever uses it in front of you you can E him to cancel it.

Be careful about taking long fights, Samira can very quickly stack her Conqueror meaning she will turn a fight that it might look like she's losing at the start. Try to maintain push whenever possible to poke under tower and to stop Samira from recalling to heal and buy lifesteal. In teamfights ALWAYS save your E for Samira's ultimate, instantly silence her when she uses it to cancel her.",

Don't be afraid to use your Q into Sivir's spellshield (E), its cooldown is long and not enough to negate your constant poke. Always stand outside of you minion wave so Sivir's W doesn't bounce to you, instead play inside the lane bushes.

If Lucian is healthy enough to fight you should always save your E to be used reactively, E him the moment he dashes in, then land Q and run out of his range. When Lucian is level 6 make sure you always have minions to hide behind, Lucian should look to use his R to poke you out as soon as you don't have creeps.

Don't run too far past your minions when trying to trade, you can get caught out in Ashe's slows while tanking enemy creeps and take a ton of damage. At level 6 Ashe can very easily all-in you with her R, stay far back or behind your ADC where you can't be hit. Mikael's Crucible is almost always the best item to build after Mythic versus Ashe, use your teammates to tank her R then cleanse them.

Try to pin Twitch to his tower and prevent him from recalling to heal, be careful of his all-in as he can stealth on you after a recall.. In teamfights save your E to be ready to use on Twitch the moment he exits stealth, this will give your team time to turn on him while he can't Flash away.",

Aim your Q at where Draven's axes are landing to be more likely to hit him or make him drop his axes, and don't ever try trade autoattacks even when you hit Q.

Play in the lane bushes to avoid Varus' poke and get close enough to hit Q, anytime he wastes his Q or E you can run out and fight him with autoattacks. At level 6 be careful of Varus' all-in as he's at his strongest, Mikael's Crucible is a great 1st item after your Mythic to cleanse Varus' ultimate.

Wait for Kalista to use an autoattack and hop, then you can use your Q / E on where she hops to and she won't be able to avoid it. Play in the lane bushes and consider buying Sweeping Lens early for it, Kalista's autoattacks will miss if she loses vision of you so constantly run into the bushes during trades.",

At level 3 Xayah can 1 shot you in CC, play around her W and E cooldowns trading when she doesn't have them. Watch out for Xayah's feather poke in lane, it's often best to stand outside of the minions near the lane bushes as there will be less feathers for her to hit you with E.",

Any time Lux wastes her Q you should run up aggressively and fight her with Q as you don't have to be afraid of an all-in without it.

Yuumi has to autoattack for her passive to get mana, when she stands still to autoattack use your Q + E and commit to fighting her. Stay close to the minions in lane so you can run into the wave whenever Yuumi uses her Q.

Be careful walking up to Zyra when she has her E, poke just using your Q and only commit to auto attacks when she doesn't have her E.

You should constantly spam your Q and E off of cooldown to try and poke Seraphine out. Don't commit to trading with autoattacks if Seraphine has her passive + E up, this is the only time you can get caught out.

Be careful at level 3 as Xerath can burst you from full, only poke with Q and reserve auto attacks from when he doesn't have his abilities up.
